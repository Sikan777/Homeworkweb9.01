# Homework SCRAPY #9 

## Task Description
Choose either BeautifulSoup library or the Scrapy framework. Your task is to perform web scraping on the http://quotes.toscrape.com website. The goal is to obtain two files: quotes.json, where you will store all information about the quotes from all pages of the website, and authors.json, where information about the authors of the specified quotes will be located. The structure of the JSON files should match the one from the previous homework assignment. Execute the previously written scripts to load the JSON files into a cloud-based database.

### Additional Task
Use the Scrapy framework for web scraping. Run the crawler as a single script main.py.

## Usage
Install the required packages:

``` bash
pip install scrapy
```
Run the Scrapy spider:

``` bash
python main.py
```
Ensure that the structure of the JSON files (quotes.json and authors.json) aligns with the requirements from the previous homework assignment.
